# Motivation

### Otherwise, this presentation would be a nap opportunity

---
# Motivation

Have you faced any of these problems lately?

- Feel things are constantly disorganized

- Cannot reproduce your analysis in your friend's computer

- Don't remember how to run your analysis

- Are afraid of changing one line and breaking everything

Then you will benefit from this work!

# Spoilers

### So you know this is really worth it

---
# Spoilers

In this presentation, I will:

- Introduce RStudio projects

- Teach a powerful, yet simple, project template

- Show how to extend it (e.g. `{shiny}` apps)

- Discuss a bit about version control

- Mention some tools for advanced users

# Enough! Let's start

---
# Project structure

- Project structure is a technical name for how you organize your files in your project

- The goal is to **save time** by enforcing **organization**

- Always aim for the simplest structure that does the job

.footnote[You can find examples of projects that follow the structures [here](https://github.com/GiuseppeTT/R-Project-Structure/tree/main/example).]

# No structure

### Because everything starts as a draft

---
# No structure

```{r}
directory("my-project/", list(
    "data.csv",
    "professor-instructions.pdf",
    "pretty-figure.png",
    "analysis.R"
))
```

# No structure (RStudio project)

```{r}
directory("my-project/", list(
    "data.csv",
    "professor-instructions.pdf",
    "pretty-figure.png",
    "analysis.R",
    "my-project.Rproj"

# Basic template

### 80% of results for 20% of effort

---
# Basic template

```{r}
directory("my-project/", list(
    directory("data/", list(
        "data.csv"
    )),
    directory("extra/", list(
        "professor-instructions.pdf"
    )),
    directory("output/", list(
        "pretty-figure.png"
    )),
    directory("R/", list(
    )),
    "analysis.R",
    "my-project.Rproj"
))
```

---
# Basic template

```{r}
directory("my-project/", list(
    directory("data/", list(
    )),
    directory("extra/", list(
    )),
    directory("output/", list(
    )),
    directory("R/", list(
    )),
    "analysis.R",
    "my-project.Rproj"
))
```

# Basic template extensions

### Only a Sith deals in absolutes

---
# Extensions: subfolders

```{r}
directory("my-project/", list(
    directory("data/", list(
        directory("clean/", list(
        )),
        directory("raw/", list(
        ))
    )),
    directory("extra/", list(
    )),
    directory("output/", list(
        directory("figure/", list(
        )),
        directory("model/", list(
        )),
        directory("table/", list(
        ))
    )),
    directory("R/", list(
    )),
    "analysis.R",
    "clean.R",
    "my-project.Rproj"
))
```

---
# Extensions: R Markdown (simplified)

```{r}
directory("my-project/", list(
    directory("data/", list(
    )),
    directory("extra/", list(
    )),
    directory("output/", list(
        "presentation.html",
        "report.pdf"
    )),
    directory("R/", list(
    )),
    "presentation.Rmd",
    "report.Rmd",
    "my-project.Rproj"
))
```

---
# Extensions: R Markdown

```{r}
directory("my-project/", list(
    directory("data/", list(
    )),
    directory("extra/", list(
    )),
    directory("output/", list(
        "presentation.html",
        "report.pdf"
    )),
    directory("R/", list(
    )),
    directory("Rmd/", list(
        "presentation.Rmd",
        "report.Rmd"
    )),
    "render.R",
    "my-project.Rproj"
))
```

---
# Extensions: R Markdown

Remember to set the "Knit Directory" option to "Project Directory" so your R Markdown files will knit relative to the project folder instead of `Rmd/`

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../inst/image/knit-directory-options.png", error = FALSE)
```

---
# Extensions: shiny

```{r}
directory("my-project/", list(
    directory("data/", list(
    )),
    directory("extra/", list(
    )),
    directory("output/", list(
    )),
    directory("R/", list(
        "functions.R",
        "global.R",
        "server.R",
        "ui.R"
    )),
    "app.R",
    "my-project.Rproj"
))
```

# Intermediate template

### You don't need it until you do

---
# Intermediate template

```{r}
directory("my-project/", list(
    directory("data/", list(
    )),
    directory("extra/", list(
    )),
    directory("output/", list(
    )),
    directory("R/", list(
    )),
    ".gitignore",
    "README.md",
    "analysis.R",
    "my-project.Rproj"
))
```

---
# Intermediate template

Version control:

- Version control is a technical name for git/GitHub

- Basicaly a `CTRL+Z` on steroids

- Solves problems like `Project_v3_final_truly_final_version2.zip`

- Essential for teamwork coding

- Great for sharing your work!

# Advanced structure

### A different way to think, a stronger way to code

---
# Advanced structure

Use the package structure (yeah, not intuitive):

- Established structure

- Free dependency management with `devtools::install_deps()`

- Access to a lot of useful packages:

    - `{devtools}` for development

    - `{roxygen2}` for documentation

    - `{testthat}` for unit testing

- Access to a lot of pre-made solutions

- Easy to share with `devtools::install_github("repository/project")`

.footnote[You can find more information about the package structure [here](https://r-pkgs.org/).]

---
# Advanced structure

Some advanced tools:
- `{here}` to build reliable relative paths

- `{usethis}` to setup project

- `{targets}` to structure analysis

- `{renv}` to manage R packages strictly

- `{lintr}` to enforce code consistency

- `{rsconnect}` and/or GitHub Pages to host presentations, reports, dashboards, apis, etc

- `docker` to solve **all** dependency problems

- GitHub Actions to automate everything above

# Key takeaways

### The only thing here you need to pay attention to

---
# Key takeaways

Key takeaways:

- If your project is going to take more than one **day**, use at least the **basic** structure

- If your project is going to take more than one **coder**, try to use at least the **intermediate** structure

- If your project is going to take **a lot of** time and/or people, consider the **advanced** structure

- Extend them as necessary, they are flexible!

- BUT, don't overcomplicate
